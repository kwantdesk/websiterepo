# KWANTDESK important notes

This is the persistent launch ledger for material work that is incomplete,
provider-blocked or unsafe to forget. Every task handoff should include a short
recap of the open items below and update this file when their state changes.

## P0 — Historical market-data coverage

- **Options-underlying candles:** QuantData was directly verified on
  2026-09-04 to return real 2025-01-03 one-minute bars for all 13 physical
  targets: SPX, SPY, QQQ, NDX, IWM, AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, META, AMD
  and VIX. The checkpointed production VPS backfill is active and targets
  every physical options-underlying ticker from 2025-01-01. At the first
  post-deploy snapshot it had completed 88 of 113 attempted ticker/sessions,
  with 24 holiday/empty observations awaiting confirmation and one partial
  awaiting retry. It is intentionally blocked
  during the US cash session so history can never consume the quota needed by
  live GEX/tickers. Keep this item open until the production ledger proves all
  available sessions are complete.
- **VXN:** QuantData returned zero VXN rows for 2025-01-03 and the production
  Massive/index-provider credential is not configured. VXN live and intraday
  history therefore remain provider-blocked. Acquire an explicitly licensed
  VXN-capable source before presenting it as live or historically complete.
- **Historical option contracts/chains/tape:** underlying QQQ/META/VIX candles
  are not option-contract history. QuantData responses are archived from the
  day capture began, but January-2025 full chains, Greeks, open interest and
  trade tape have not been proven available. Confirm QuantData entitlement and
  retention or procure the planned licensed historical options source; never
  reconstruct past surfaces with future data.
- **Futures minute bars:** the Rithmic History Plant queue covers all 53 offered
  CME-group roots from 2025-01-01 and remains in progress/retry. Do not call it
  complete until its production ledger has no unresolved real-root windows.
- **Futures event charts:** historical tick, volume, range, Renko and Footprint
  require the separate trade-tick/VAP import. They must never be fabricated
  from minute OHLC.

## P0 — Launch reliability

- Preserve the live-feed priority rule: no bulk history, archive compaction or
  analytics work may compete with Rithmic or QuantData during the US market
  open. A healthy HTTP process is not sufficient; live timestamps and recorder
  counters must advance.
- The dedicated Vultr volume is primary recording storage, not an off-site
  backup. Add and restore-test nightly object-storage replication before the
  public launch.
